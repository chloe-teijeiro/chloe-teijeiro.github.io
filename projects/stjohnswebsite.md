I recently worked as part of a team to design and build a website for Saint John Apostle and Evangelist Catholic Church. Our goal was to create a clear and easy-to-navigate site that would help parishioners find information and connect with ministries. We used Solutio Software, which is a company that builds templated, customizable websites for Catholic churches and dioceses. Together, we designed the website's layout, tabs, and submenus. 

After we decided on the layout and content, I added the majority of verbiage (written by others) to the pages. I uploaded all of the PDF links, embedded files, and connected the relevant resources. I also added contact links for each ministry and council within the website's submenu, connecting them to the appropriate individuals and ensuring the contact buttons led to the correct information. Additionally, I came up with a way to allow easy contact updates when leaders are changed, without redoing the entire structure. I did not write code for this project; I used Solutio’s dashboard and form-based editor to manage the website’s content and layout.

This project was bigger than I expected. It taught me a lot about the complexity of structuring websites for real-world users. I learned the importance of maintainability and how to organize backend content to simplify future updates. With the help of my teammates, I also gained a greater understanding of the importance of a quality user experience, especially when navigating a large number of ministries and contacts. This project taught me that even without coding, web design still requires logic, planning, and attention to detail.
