Honestly, I feel like a new swimmer who is diving into the deep end of the pool. I know how to swim, but my toes can’t touch the bottom. In this scenario, my coding knowledge is the dog paddle, and Typescript is the breaststroke. While I’m confident that I can learn this new stroke, the depth of the water in this pool of knowledge is still an intimidating factor.

## At least I have floaties

The practice WODs really help, and I appreciate the video solution that you can watch after completing your first attempt. I’ve never been one to work at a super fast pace, so I probably feel the time pressure more than most. Being able to repeat the practice WODs allows me to gain a level of comfort with both the pace and the process. I also find that doing the TA WODs has helped me to stay afloat.

## Swimming Laps 

I’m new to Typescript, but I can already see how it is useful for software design and development. I really love that it shows you errors as you write your code. I don’t understand why this isn’t a feature in all programming languages. I see Typescript as the diving platform to launch myself into the process and each WOD as a lap in my training to become a lifeguard, or at least a good swimmer.
